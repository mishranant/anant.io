# Why TF is Crypto so hot

Published on: 2024-01-07

Cryptocurrency is the new kid on the block (once again). The environment is ready for the next bull run in the crypto market and investors are getting ready to fuckin' blow it all up on DeFi, DePIN, web3 and everything between that and memecoins.

BUT, why is crypto so fuckin' volatile? Howcome Bitcoin makes 10% move in a day like it is nobody's business?

## Crypto is volatile

There are multiple reasons why crypto is volatile, most prominent one of them all is that it is a relatively small asset class, even after 15 years of launch of the Bitcoin network <a href="">insert whitepaper or some shit here</a>.

The current size of the whole Cryptocurrency market stands at single digit trillions as compared to xyz size of the global Gold market <a href="">link</a> and abc size of the real estate market of Bharat <a href="">link</a>
Even the Stock market in Bharat is $uvw billion.

There's a simple principle that states it is easier to move the price of a 1 trillion asset than it is to move the price of 10 trillion assest, that is because to double the price, you would need to add just another trillion in the first case, but 10 trillion in the latter.

There's also the factor that Crypto is a relatively new <a href="">link</a> asset class and due to the lack of any precedence, there is absolutely no motherfuckin' set of expectation
