## What is up with the Gregorian New Year?
 Some of us celebrate it passionately, others do because we kinda have to.
 We have our own Chaitra new year that commences around April, different regions in Bharat, call it different things:
 1. Gudi Padwa
 2. 

# Which language do you speak?

In an ideal scenario, Bharat should have been united by Sanskrit (not san-skrit but Sun-skrit), as it used to be in the earlier ages (add some references here, how Bengali traders communicated with Malayali's; Chola Empire spread sanskrit to the SEA region despite themselves being Tamil)

But due to the complicated history of Bharat, the country is currently unified by an unnatural combination of English and Hindi.

I live Bengaluru (anglicized as Bangalore), which belongs to the Karnataka state. The language here is Kannada.

At the time of independence, the states in Bharat were divided in accordance with language.

I belong to Uttar Pradesh, the largest state in Bharat, my native tongue is Hindi.

But due to migrations and shit, I learnt Punjabi, English and Kannada as well. That is the story of many Bharatiyas we are atleast bilingual, most of us are trilingual and a few of us are quadra+ lingual.
